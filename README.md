This project was a great opportunity to practice my HTML and CSS skills. I learned how to use CSS Grid and Flexbox to create a responsive layout.

### Continued development

I plan to continue working on this project to improve its accessibility and performance.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me understand CSS Grid and Flexbox better. I really liked their clear and concise explanations.
